# 🚢 EDA on Titanic Dataset

This is a mini project showcasing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the **Titanic dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning and data science.

## 📌 Project Highlights

The notebook demonstrates the following EDA steps:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**
  - Handling missing values
  - Renaming columns
  - Dropping irrelevant features

- 📊 **Data Aggregation & Filtering**
  - Grouping data by categories (e.g., Sex, Pclass)
  - Filtering based on logical conditions

- 📈 **Data Visualization**
  - **Bar Chart**
  - **Histogram**
  - **Scatter Plot**

These visualizations help uncover patterns and relationships between features such as survival rate by gender, passenger class, and age.
